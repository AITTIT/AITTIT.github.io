These are my two Certification Projects from freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.
The first one is a simple webssite containing information on Alexander the Great with some CSS formatting.
The second project page can be accessed from a link at the bottom of the first page. 
The second project is a simple survey form with no actual back end, but just the formatting.
